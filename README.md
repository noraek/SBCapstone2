Reports and code related to second Springboard capstone project. 

Animals all over the world are waiting in shelters for adoptive homes.  And the length of time before an adopter is found can literally mean the difference between life and death.  One organization is looking to data science to help find a solution.  Petfinder.my is Malaysiaâ€™s leading pet welfare platform.  Site visitors can search for new pets by location, type, breed, color, gender and age, among other criteria.

Petfinder.my partnered with Kaggle, the data science competition website, to launch a new challenge using pet adoption data pulled from the site.  Petfinder.my wanted to know: Can a machine learning model accurately predict how soon a pet will be adopted?  With this information they hope to improve pet profiles so animals find forever homes faster.
